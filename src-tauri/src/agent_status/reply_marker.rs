//! The optional reply status marker (roadmap B9). A finished Claude Code turn
//! alone does not say whether Claude is waiting for an answer or is done. When
//! the user switches this on in Settings → AI Agent, a short instruction block
//! goes into the user's global `CLAUDE.md` asking Claude to end every reply with
//! one marker line; the session scan reads that line from the transcript
//! (sessions.rs), leaves it out of the shown reply, and reports it as
//! `replyMarker`. Off by default: the block is the user's global instruction, so
//! the island only writes it on request and removes only its own block.

## Reply status marker (added by Fuyu)

End every reply with one extra line that holds only one of these characters, so Fuyu can show what this session is waiting for:

- `↩` the next step is the user's: you asked a question, offered options or a next step (\"want me to…?\"), asked them to do something and tell you, or need their decision, approval or input
- `⋯` nothing is needed from the user yet: you ended the turn only to wait for a background task you started (a background command, a subagent, a monitor, a scheduled wake-up) that will wake you
- `✓` the work the user asked for is finished, nothing is left for them to answer or decide, and nothing you started is still running

When more than one fits, `↩` wins over `⋯`, and `⋯` over `✓`. When unsure, use `↩`.

Write the character alone on the last line, without backticks, and nothing after it. To stop, switch off \"Reply status marker\" in Fuyu's Settings → AI Agent, which deletes this file.";
